								<b>Job Advertisement!</b> <a href="NPS-CaRS-ORISE-postdoc-intern-ad-112022.pdf" style="color:rgb(33, 168, 209)">ORISE Postdoctoral Intern</a></p>
								
								<p>The Clouds and Remote Sensing (CaRS) group at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, 
								California, continues to seek postdoctoral associates to support the groupâ€™s reimbursably funded research 
								program. Because NPS is a Federal institution, there are two primary ways that interested candidates can apply
								for a postdoc opportunity. The first is through the National Research Council (NRC) 
								<a href="https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/RAP">Research Associateship Programs (RAP)</a>. The other way
								to join the group is through participating in an <a href="https://orise.orau.gov/internships-fellowships/postdocs.html">
								ORISE internship</a>. Both opportunities are open to both U.S.
								citizens and non-citizens from countries permitted by NPS. Descriptions of ongoing projects are listed below.
								Interested individuals should contact the PI directly.<br><br>

								We currently recommend that interested candidates contact the PI before applying and that they ultimately 
								apply through the <a href="https://orise.orau.gov/internships-fellowships/postdocs.html">ORISE program</a> 
								We can offer housing allowances through ORISE that help offset the high cost of housing
								in and around the Monterey Peninsula as well as funding to help offset the cost of health, vision, and dental insurance.
								Postdocs will also have opportunities to travel to conferences to present their research. Opportunities may be
								available for the projects listed below. Please enquire with the PI for availability. The ORISE application portal for 
								all opportunities below is <a href="https://www.zintellect.com/Opportunity/Details/NPS-2022-0002">here</a>.
							

								<ul>
									<!-- <li>Applying Machine Learning to Satellite Data: The postdoc would develop new deep learning architectures
										using geostationary and passive microwave data. They would work with advisers and other group members at NPS 
										to develop, train, and validate new neural network architectures capable of providing uncertainty for its
										predictions and develop the ability to use active learning to improve performance of existing models.
										The project is led by Dr. Marko Orescanin in the Dept. of Computer
										Science at NPS, and the postdoc would be co-advised by both he and Dr. Scott Powell, the CaRS group leader. 
									</li> -->

									<li>

										Convective Cloud Processes and Precipitation: The postdoc would analyze radar data, satellite observations, rawinsonde 
										data, and aircraft data to investigate the physical processes involved in convective initiation and the growth of shallow 
										convection into deep convection near terrain features during the <a href="https://www.arm.gov/research/campaigns/amf2018cacti">
										DOE CACTI field campaign</a> and the 
										<a href="calico.html">CALifornia Investigation of Convection over Ocean (CALICO)</a>. The 
										postdoc would also be responsible for conducting high-resolution numerical experiments on a supercomputer and analyzing model 
										output. The postdoc would participate in generating data-derived products to release to the broader scientific community.

									</li>

									<li>
										Large-Scale Tropical Dynamics: The postdoc would work on a collaborative project with the University of Wisconsin to investigate
										cloud-scale dynamic processes that are potentially important for propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) through the 
										Maritime Continent. The project combines observational analysis with develop of improved cumulus parameterizations that may be
										tested and hopefully eventually implemented into NOAA's numerical prediction framework for weather and climate prediction. 

									</li>


								</ul>
								
									Initial funding for postdocs is provided for 1 year and may be extended for a second year if performance is satisfactory. 
									Please see the ORISE posting for more information. Salary and housing/insurance/travel allowances will be determined at the time of
									application. While exact start dates are negotiable, we are interested in adding 
									to our research teams as soon as possible. Potential candidates interested in applying for any opportunity through NRC should contact
									the PI for more information.
